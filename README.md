# GANs-Regret_Minimization
Probabilistic future video frame prediction using Generative Adversarial Networks by employing a regret minimization strategy for training GANs.

As proposed by Ian Goodfellow in 2014, Generative Adversarial Networks are essentially two networks, a Generator and a Discriminator, pressed against eachother that learn from the opposite one's losses in a minmax game.
